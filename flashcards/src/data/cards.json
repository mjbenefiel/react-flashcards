            "answer": "A tag is a term used in the web technology and analytics industry to describe a small snippet of code that is placed on a website for the purpose of tracking important visitor activity. Tags are also known as tracking pixels or web beacons. Tags are commonly used by marketers to measure the effectiveness of online advertising, email marketing, site personalization, and conversion tracking (among many other uses). This is accomplished via data sharing wherein contextual information from the webpage is passed to the tag in accordance with the vendor's formatting requirements. The most common methodology for implementing a tag onto a website is to use a small snippet of JavaScript code."
